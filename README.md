# FaceOff

FaceOff is a Chrome Extension to implements the 2-click "like" button as seen on the [German tech-news site Heise](http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/2-Klicks-fuer-mehr-Datenschutz-1333879.html).

The reason I want a 2-click "like" button instead of blocking Facebook plugins outright is respect for content owner. If the content owner has a "like" button, then I should be willing to share the content if I find it worth sharing.

Right now it's 2am in the morning (my time), so I am going to bed.

I did a quick mock of what I will build. I'll start coding tomorrow morning. Watch this repo if you are interested.
